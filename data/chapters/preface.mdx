## Welcome to the Future of Software

We stand at a precipice. For decades, software engineering has been defined by the syntax we memorize, the libraries we master, and the manual translation of human logic into machine instructions. That era is ending.

This book, *AI-Native & Spec-Driven Software Development: Zero to Production*, is not just a tutorial; it is a manifesto for a new methodology. We are moving from writing code to architecting intent.

### The Core Thesis

Traditional development is imperative: you tell the machine *how* to do something step-by-step. AI-Native development is declarative and specification-driven: you clearly define *what* the outcome must be, and you orchestrate AI agents to bridge the gap between intent and implementation.

In this book, we will build a production-grade system—a RAG-based knowledge engine—using this new workflow. We will use Docusaurus for documentation, FastAPI for the backend, Qdrant for vector storage, and the OpenAI Agents SDK (and Google GenAI SDK) for intelligence.

Let us begin.
