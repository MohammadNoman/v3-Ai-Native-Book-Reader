## 2.1 The Spec is the Source of Truth

In traditional Agile, documentation is an afterthought. In SDD, documentation is the *first* step. Before a single line of code is written, we write a **Technical Specification Document (TSD)**.

### 2.2 Anatomy of a Perfect Spec

An AI-ready spec must be: 
- **Contextual**: It must define the 'Why' and 'Who'.
- **Atomic**: Broken down into small, isolated components.
- **Testable**: Must describe success criteria explicitly.

<div className="bg-slate-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
  <h4 className="text-brand-400 font-bold mb-2">Example: User Authentication Spec</h4>
  <pre className="text-xs text-slate-300 overflow-x-auto">
{`# Component: AuthManager

## Interface
- input: email (str), password (str)
- output: JWT (str) | Error

## Constraints
- Password strength: min 8 chars, 1 special, 1 number.
- Hashing: Argon2id.
- Token Expiry: 15 minutes.

## Workflow
1. Validate input format.
2. Retrieve user hash from DB.
3. Verify password.
4. If valid, sign JWT with HS256.`}
  </pre>
</div>

When you feed this spec to an LLM, the ambiguity is removed. The model doesn't need to guess which hashing algorithm to use; you told it.

## 2.3 The Feedback Loop

Spec-Driven Development is recursive. You write a draft spec -> Agent reviews it -> You refine it -> Agent generates code -> Agent generates tests -> Tests fail -> You update the SPEC (not just the code).

Fixing the spec prevents the same bug from reappearing next time you regenerate the code. The Spec is your persistent memory.
