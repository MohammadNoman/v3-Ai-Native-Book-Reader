# Environment Variables Setup

This file is a template for your local environment variables.
Copy this to `.env.local` and fill in your actual API key.

## Required Variables

### Gemini API Key
Get your free API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

```
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Important Notes

1. **VITE_ Prefix**: The `VITE_` prefix is required for environment variables that need to be accessible in the browser (client-side code).

2. **Local Development**: Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your API key.

3. **Vercel Deployment**: Add the environment variable in your Vercel project settings:
   - Go to your project on Vercel
   - Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add: `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your API key value
   - Make sure to redeploy after adding the variable

4. **Security**: Never commit `.env.local` to git. It's already in `.gitignore`.

## Troubleshooting

If the AI Chat is not working:
- Check that `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local` (local) or Vercel settings (production)
- Verify the API key is valid at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- Redeploy on Vercel after adding environment variables
- Check browser console for error messages
